2. Food recipes 
    - Allows users to view a list of food recipes extracted from a public API. There will also be a tab for users to favorite any recipes and potentially another tab for users that stores recipes they have completed. The second tab would have a "Notes" section for users to add any modifications they made to the recipe or any other comments they had about the dish
3. Workout ideas
    - Allows users to view a list of workout routines extracted from a public API. There will also be a tab for users to favorite any workouts and potentially another tab for users that stores workouts they have completed.

4. Diet tracker
    - Allows users to keep track of what they ate through a calendar view. Each entry allows users to identify it as a meal or snack, and the calories consumed. There will also be a cell in the entry that automatically calculates the sum of calories consumed based on what the users have entered.
