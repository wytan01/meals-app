## Overview
Any user that installed Egg-cellent Cook will be an excellent chef after trying out many recipes available on this app!

### Description

This app allows users to view a list of food recipes extracted from a public API. Users can tap on a recipe to see the details, such as the cooking instructions and ingredients needed. They can also favorite the recipes or mark them as completed once they have tried cooking them. There will be a "Favorites" tab for users to view their favorite recipes and a "Completed" tab to see recipes they have completed. 

### App Evaluation

- **Category:** Cooking
- **Mobile:** Mobile is essential for the accessibility to obtain recipes since we always have our phones on us. Also have various tabs that are easily accessible for users to view recipes they like or have completed.
- **Story:** Allows users to develop their cooking skills and expand the types/cuisines of food they cook. With detailed recipes, it makes cooking less intimidating for individuals who do not cook often.
- **Market:** Any individual who is interested in cooking or trying out new recipes could use this app. District wide licensing and custom features could be used for monetization. 
- **Habit:** Individuals will use the app daily to choose from a wide range of recipes because they are easily accessible
- **Scope:** V1 would just extract a large list of diverse recipes from an API for users to scroll and view them. V2 would incorporate a "Favorites" tab so users can have a separate tab to view all recipes they're interested in. V3 would add a "Completed" tab so users can have a separate tab to view all recipes they've completed. V4 allows users to add any notes they want on any completed recipe
